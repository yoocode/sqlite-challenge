Use music.db to solve following challengers.

Use Notepad for scripting and revision

1. Select the titles of all the songs on the album "Forbidden".
2. Repeat the previous query but this time display the songs in track order. You may want to 
include the track number in the output to verify that it worked ok.
3. Display all songs for the band "Deep Purple".
4. Rename the band "mehitabel" to "One Kitten". Note that this is an exception to the advice
to always fuly qualify your column names. SET artists.name won't work, you just need to specify name.
5. Check that the record was correctly renamed.
6. Select the titles of all the songs by Aerosmith in alphabetical order.
Include only the title in the output.
7. Replace the column that you used in the previous answer with count (title) to get just a count of
the number of songs.
8. Search the internet to find out how to get a list of the songs from step 6 without any duplicates.
9. Search the internet again to find out how to get a count of the songs without duplicates.
Hint: It uses the same keyword as step 8 but the syntax may not be obvious.
10. Repeat the previous query to find the number of artists (which, obviously, should be one) and the number of albums.
